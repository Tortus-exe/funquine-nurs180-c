# Hello!

This is a **quine** written in C that will print some uplifting messages!

A **quine** is a program that prints itself. In this case, the program will copy itself to another file, then rebuild itself, over and over, much like the recursive process of reflecting on oneself to improve oneself. 

To use, please ensure:
- `gcc` is installed at `/usr/bin/gcc`
- `make` is installed

If you are unsure, please try the program at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/linux_terminal_online.php

In the terminal at the website, please copy and paste the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tortus-exe/funquine-nurs-180-c.git; cd funquine-nurs-180-c; make
```

then, when you wish to run the program, please type:
```
./quine
```

The program will run forever. If you wish to stop the program, you can cancel it by pressing CTRL-c. (This will not copy text, it is a special terminal shortcut).
