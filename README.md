# Hello!

This is a **quine** written in C that will print some uplifting messages!

A **quine** is a program that prints itself. In this case, the program will copy itself to another file, then rebuild itself, over and over, much like the recursive process of reflecting on oneself to improve oneself. 

To use, please ensure:
- `gcc` is installed
- `make` is installed

If you are unsure, please try the program at https://replit.com/@Tortus0/funquine

You may need to create a replit account. Once this is done, it should be able to run.

The program will run forever. If you wish to stop the program, you can cancel it by pressing CTRL-c. (This will not copy text, it is a special terminal shortcut).
